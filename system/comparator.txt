# File comparator:
# compare the genenerated snapshot to a specification file. 
# 

# Core Behavior:
# compare a specification file with a snapshot. 

# Possible script name: file comparator


# Expectations:
# What I want: 

# Flexible assumptions(subject to change):
	# The script will be executed through a make target.
	# 

# Create a function that can load both types of files(snapshot and spec file)
	# This can this be done via CLI?
	# Goal: make it easy for the developer to compare the files.
# Create compare function.
	# How is this done?
		Brain-storming:
		# Hold one file constant then walk the other file line by line(comparing as you go)?


# Point of confusion:
Given that I have the following make target:

When I execute:
	# diff-structure manual drift review
diff-structure:
	@echo "🔍 Diffing current structure against system/structure.spec..."
	@test -f $(SNAPSHOT_GEN) || (echo "❌ Missing: $(SNAPSHOT_GEN)" && exit 1)
	@bash $(SNAPSHOT_GEN) generate_structure_spec . > .structure.snapshot
	@diff -u $(STRUCTURE_SPEC) .structure.snapshot || echo "⚠️  Drift detected — review above diff."


Then what the difference between that target and  File comparator I am wanting to create?



Relying solely on your diff-structure target carries a few trade‑offs—most of them around flexibility, reliability, and scalability. Here’s what to watch out for if you stick with it long‑term:

    Limited Parameterization

        You’re locked into generating .structure.snapshot in the CWD and comparing against whatever $(STRUCTURE_SPEC) is set to in your Makefile.

        You can’t easily point it at different snapshots or spec files, or run it from another directory, without editing the target.

    No Noise‑Filtering

        A raw diff -u will show every change, including transient files (e.g. editor swap files, OS metadata) that you might want to ignore.

        You can’t pass in --ignore-matching-lines or regex filters without wrapping diff in extra flags or scripts.

    Unstructured Output

        You only get a unified diff and a “⚠️ Drift detected” banner.

        There’s no summary (e.g. “12 entries added, 5 removed”), no JSON for machine‑consumption, and no HTML/email report for stakeholders.

    Masked Exit Codes

        Because your Makefile ends with … || echo "⚠️ Drift detected", the exit code will be 0 even when drift exists.

        That means CI pipelines won’t fail, tests won’t catch drift automatically, and downstream scripts can’t react (e.g. send alerts or block a merge).

    Harder CI/CD Integration

        Without distinct exit codes or a flag set, you can’t gate merges or deployments on “no drift.”

        You’d need to wrap make diff-structure in another script to detect drift from stdout.

    Maintainability & Reuse

        If you ever need the same logic elsewhere (different repo, different team), you’ll end up copy‑pasting this Make target or building ad‑hoc wrappers.

        A standalone comparator script centralizes the logic, making it easier to document, test, and version independently.
