# INVARIANTS — structure_validator.sh
# ===================================

# 1. Input Contract Invariant
# ---------------------------
# - The script must be invoked with a valid `structure.spec` file (unless using `--help`).
# - `structure.spec` must exist and be a readable file.
# - If `--help` or no argument is passed, usage is shown and exit is EXIT_OK (0).

# 2. Line Type Recognition Invariant
# ----------------------------------
# - Each line in the spec must be recognized as:
#   - `dir: path`
#   - `file: path`
#   - `link: src -> tgt`
#   - or a valid raw relative path (fallback)
# - Lines that are comments (`#`) or empty are skipped.

# 3. Path Resolution Invariant
# ----------------------------
# - All paths are evaluated relative to the current working directory at runtime.

# 4. Strict Existence Invariant
# -----------------------------
# - A `dir:` line must point to a directory (`-d`)
# - A `file:` line must point to a file (`-f`)
# - A `link:` line must:
#   - point to a symlink (`-L`)
#   - and match the expected target via `readlink`
# - Untyped fallback paths must exist as a file, directory, or symlink
# - If any validation fails, the script exits immediately.

 

# 6. Log Separation Invariant
# ---------------------------
# - If `--quiet` is passed, logging is suppressed.
# - Otherwise, human-readable, color-coded logs are printed.

# 7. Fail Fast Invariant
# ----------------------
# - The script stops at the first validation failure.
# - Only one failure is reported per run, immediately with correct exit code.


#What does this script achieve?
# --> Will read the specification file and validate the structure(format) of the
# --> specification file. I think what this scripts' current focus is to ensure that 
# --> the script(debuggingTools/structure-debug.sh generate_structure_spec .) that 
# --> generated the structure specification file did its job correctly.
#     --> So what I think this script( as well as variations ) percieved functionality is that
#     --> it will take a spec file and validate the structure against the following rules:
 
 

# Over-arching question: Is the capability of {validation of structure} == {enforcement of policy rules} 
#                       or is this something else? 
#                         --> The two capabilities are different. 

 
#                    Capabilities of the system under testing: 
                      # 1.) validation of structure
                      # 2.) enforcement of policy rules
# Will need to: identify what some edge cases may be,
#                    and clarify the distinction between 
#                    valiation of structure vs enforcement policy rules.
# I feel like validation of structure has to do with with the actual reading and writing
# of the system level elements?
# Enforcement of policy rules is the capability to notify of structural drift. These
# rules are set by the expectations that were put in place by the developer/user/agent(?)
# In essence, the set of expecations are invariants, variants, and volatile categories 
# that can be used to monitor for structural(maybe behavioral?) drift.



# Why is this important?
# --> This script appears to be acting as a kind of linter for the specification file.
#     --QUESTION: DOES ONLY THE SPECIFICATION FILE NEED TO BE RUN THROUGH A LINTER OR CAN 
#                 THE SNAPSHOT ALSO BE INCLUDED? 
# --> If the specficiation file causes an exit code other then 0
# --> then the next step(policy file reading & enforcement) cannot proceed. 
 

# How will it do this?
# --> The "linting behavior" will be accomplished by using modular functions.
# --> Reading the policy rule file should be delegated to another script.

# What do I want? I want to maintain these invariants(as examples): 
# #- type: invariant
#   path: ^module/
#   condition: must_exist
#   action: error

# - type: invariant
#   path: ^system/
#   condition: must_exist
#   action: error

# - type: invariant
#   path: ^config/
#   condition: must_exist
#   action: error

# - type: invariant
#   path: ^config/policy.rules.yaml
#   condition: must_exist
#   action: error 

# That is saved in the file called policy.rules.yml file.
 
# what is likely to happen: false positives, false negatives.
# what should happen: clarity, alignment, action and intent become fused,with electricity so to speak.
#                     more practically, you should be able to start focusing on signal. 
#                     The notification is a signal.
#                         --> How would I build the notification?
#                                 -> Using a script?
#                          -> Capabilities Needed:
#                                 1.) Compare the cached data(spec and/or snapshots)
#                                 2.) Apply enforcement rules
#                                 3.) Propagate appropiate status code(this is the signal)

 # TODO: break script so that it can read the specification file
 # TODO: break up script so that it can read the policy file.
 # TODO: make new script to enforce policy patterns. 

 # How will this script typically be called?(CLI vs sourced in another script)
#

# You can safely drop that -- marker for 99% of use‑cases—your parser will simply treat the very first token after CLI_STATE as the subcommand (e.g. “validate”) and then pick up the spec (and policy) filenames in turn. The only time you’d really need the -- is if you wanted to pass a filename that begins with a dash (e.g. -foo.spec), since otherwise any -… token will be treated as an option.

# So, in short:

#     Removing -- will not break your normal flows (validate structure.spec or enforce -p policy.rules structure.spec).

#     You’ll lose only the ability to disambiguate “real” positional args that themselves start with -.

# If you never have spec or policy names that begin with hyphens, feel free to call:

########## Things to consider ####################
 

# I need to seperate between queries and commands.
 
########## TODO #############

#### ACTION ########
# Functions still need to be refactored. 

##### DECISION #####
# What should the name of the functions be called that will enable this script to 
# read,parse, and enforce policy rule files.


#### INCREASE OF GRANULARITY ######
# Scenerios
  # 1.) Defining what is in the policy files(intent and syntax)
  # 2.) Assuming that there is a policy file that exists, how will it be read?
  # 3.) Assuming that a policy file exists and has been read, how will it be parsed?
  # 4.) Assuming that a policy file exists,has been read, parsed, how will the policy be enforced?



#1) Defining policy.rules intent
  # Given that a policy rule file exists,
  # when a system is being monitored for structural drift,
  # then a policy rule contains the logic that governs what patterns are being observed 
  # and what actions are being executed.

 #1.a) Given that system is being monitored for structural drift,
 #     when policy.rule file is written or generated
 #     then the system must be checked against the policy.
