That‚Äôs an excellent and strategic structure for main.sh. You're treating it not just as a command launcher, but as a smart orchestrator ‚Äî one that handles setup, validation, feedback, and fallbacks.

Let‚Äôs break it down with praise, critical reflection, and tactical suggestions:
‚úÖ What You're Doing Right (High-Level Pros)
1. Separation of Responsibilities via Intent-Aware Commands

Each command (e.g., initialization, context-check, self-test) plays a distinct role. This is cohesive design ‚Äî easy to extend, debug, and test.
2. Treating main.sh as a Precondition Gatekeeper

You're making sure no downstream action happens without upstream readiness. This mindset mirrors design by contract: if preconditions aren‚Äôt met, exit gracefully.
3. Failing Gracefully Implicitly

The emphasis on implicit graceful failure means you're respecting the user‚Äôs flow. The script remains a helpful assistant, not a brittle gatekeeper.
üß† Mental Model Suggestion

You can model main.sh as a pure pre-flight orchestrator, something like:

main.sh
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ validate_environment      # precondition
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run_self_test            # precondition
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ describe_context         # optional aid
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manage_dependencies      # preparation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ source_utilities         # preparation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dispatch_command         # intent routing
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ help/fallback            # graceful degrade

‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations & Caveats
1. Be Explicit with Invariants and Exit Codes

Implicit failure is good UX ‚Äî but internally, you should explicitly track:

    Which invariants must hold before execution?

    What exit codes signal soft failure vs. hard failure?

You might have:

EXIT_OK=0
EXIT_PRECONDITION_FAILED=10
EXIT_DEP_MISSING=20
EXIT_SELFTEST_FAILED=30

2. Post-conditions Should Reflect a Clean State

If run self-test passes, you might consider that a post-condition of initialization. Similarly, sourcing utilities might assume certain ENV vars ‚Äî if so, assert them before.
3. Your help should be auto-updated

If main.sh grows in options, you might eventually want the help command to reflect the available functions automatically.
üîß Tactical Improvements or Additions
‚ûï Add a --dry-run Option

To run through all preconditions without executing the final command.
‚ûï Add Logging or Verbose Toggle

So users can main.sh --verbose help or debug environment mismatches without diving into the script.
‚ûï Add a --diagnose mode

Performs everything except the final action, gives system summary, environment readiness, missing deps, etc.
üß© If You Want to Formalize This into Preconditions/Postconditions
Example:

# Precondition checks
assert_environment_ready
assert_dependencies_met
assert_utilities_loadable
assert_self_integrity

# Postcondition assertion after dispatch
validate_exit_code
validate_expected side effects (e.g., generated files)
log_success

‚úÖ Summary Judgment

Your approach is excellent:

    It aligns with command-query separation, design by contract, and resilient CLI tool patterns.

    It scales well with complexity.

    It turns main.sh from a script into a launcher, validator, and trust-builder.

Let me know if you want a skeleton template with placeholders for these commands ‚Äî or a diagram to visualize the flow.
You said:

It turns `main.sh` from a script into a **launcher, validator, and trust-builder**.
But does this violate SRP?
ChatGPT said:

Short answer: Not if you define the responsibility correctly and push the work out of main.sh.

SRP = ‚Äúone reason to change.‚Äù
Give main.sh exactly one reason to change: orchestrate a safe CLI invocation (parse ‚Üí preflight ‚Üí dispatch ‚Üí unified error/reporting). If main.sh implements initialization, self-tests, context, deps, etc., it will violate SRP. If it merely delegates to modules, it‚Äôs fine.
What ‚Äúgood SRP‚Äù looks like for main.sh

Single responsibility: Lifecycle orchestration & contract enforcement.

    Parse intent/options.

    Run preflight (only what‚Äôs needed for the requested command).

    Dispatch to an implementation function.

    Centralize logging/exit codes/failure policy.

Put the implementation behind modules:

bin/main.sh               # orchestrator only
lib/env_init.sh           # initialization (ENV contract)
lib/selftest.sh           # self-checks
lib/context_check.sh      # context/report
lib/deps.sh               # dependency checks
lib/help.sh               # usage/intent docs
lib/logger.sh             # logging facade

Heuristics to know you‚Äôre not violating SRP

    main.sh stays small (‚âà100‚Äì200 lines max) and mostly glue; no deep logic.

    Adding/removing a subcommand changes only the dispatch table and help text.

    Changing dependency logic touches only lib/deps.sh.

    Changing self-tests touches only lib/selftest.sh.

Smells of SRP violation:

    main.sh contains long functions for env probing, file IO, or business rules.

    Multiple, unrelated reasons to edit main.sh in a single PR (deps + tests + context).

    State is mutated all over main.sh rather than returned by modules.

Minimal skeleton (orchestrator as fa√ßade)

#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"

# Facade deps
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/logger.sh"
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/help.sh"
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/env_init.sh"
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/deps.sh"
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/selftest.sh"
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/context_check.sh"

EXIT_OK=0; EXIT_USAGE=64; EXIT_PRECONDITION=65; EXIT_RUNTIME=70

declare -A DISPATCH=(
  [init]=cmd_init
  [self-test]=cmd_self_test
  [context]=cmd_context
  [deps]=cmd_deps
  [help]=cmd_help
)

preflight() {
  local cmd="$1"
  # Bypass heavy checks for pure queries like help/version
  [[ "$cmd" == "help" ]] && return 0
  env_require            || return $EXIT_PRECONDITION
  deps_check --light     || return $EXIT_PRECONDITION
  self_integrity --fast  || return $EXIT_PRECONDITION
}

dispatch() {
  local cmd="${1:-help}"; shift || true
  local fn="${DISPATCH[$cmd]:-cmd_help}"
  "$fn" "$@"
}

main() {
  local cmd="${1:-help}"; shift || true
  preflight "$cmd" || { log_error "Preflight failed"; exit $EXIT_PRECONDITION; }
  dispatch "$cmd" "$@" || { log_error "Command failed"; exit $EXIT_RUNTIME; }
  exit $EXIT_OK
}

main "$@"

Design-by-Contract for main.sh

    Preconditions: required env keys present, minimal deps available, utilities sourceable, self-integrity passes.

    Postconditions: consistent exit codes, single place for error reporting, no partial side effects left on failure.

    CQS alignment: queries like help/context don‚Äôt perform mutations; commands do.

If you want even stricter SRP

Split entrypoints (e.g., bin/init, bin/deps, bin/self-test) and let main.sh only parse and re-exec the specific entrypoint. That‚Äôs a stricter fa√ßade, but usually the modular approach above is enough.

Bottom line: Your plan does not violate SRP if main.sh remains a thin orchestrator/contract enforcer and each concern lives in its own module. Otherwise, yes‚Äîmove logic out until main.sh has only one reason to change.
You said:
You generated new directories bin and lib. Elaborate
ChatGPT said:

Below is a practical break-down of what bin/ and lib/ do in a Bash-centric project, why they matter for SRP, and how to weave them into your existing structure-validator tooling.
1. Directory roles in one sentence
Directory	Primary responsibility (= one reason to change)
bin/	Executable entrypoints: thin CLI wrappers that parse user intent, run lightweight preflight, then delegate work.
lib/	Reusable modules: pure functions & helpers shared by all entrypoints (env init, logging, self-tests, dependency probes, ‚Ä¶).
Quick mental model

Think of bin/ as the public interface and lib/ as the implementation details; changing one shouldn‚Äôt force unrelated changes in the other.
2. Suggested minimal tree

project-root/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.sh          # orchestrator / dispatcher
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ init             # optional: standalone init entrypoint
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deps             # optional: standalone deps check
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚Ä¶                # other user-facing commands
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ env_init.sh      # exports/configures required env vars
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deps.sh          # dependency detection / installation prompts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ selftest.sh      # fast integrity checks
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ context.sh       # context reporting utilities
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logger.sh        # log_info / log_error / safe_log fa√ßade
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ help.sh          # auto-generated usage text
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/               # Bats tests (already in your repo)

(Names can be tweaked; stick to lowercase-with-underscores for Bash libs to avoid path clashes.)
3. Workflow & control flow

    User calls: bin/main.sh validate ./structure.spec

    main.sh (in bin):

        Resolves SCRIPT_DIR ‚Üí project root.
        Invariant: ‚Äúlib/ must be locatable from any cwd.‚Äù

        source "$PROJECT_ROOT/lib/logger.sh" ‚Ä¶ (imports helpers).

        Runs preflight (env + deps + selftest) from lib.

        Dispatches to the appropriate command handler.

    Business logic lives in lib/; functions return status codes instead of exiting where possible.

    main.sh captures status ‚Üí unified exit codes ‚Üí logs.

4. Why this layout helps SRP & testability
Benefit	How bin/ √ó lib/ delivers
Single responsibility	bin/main.sh only changes when orchestration rules change; lib/* changes when underlying logic changes.
Unit testing	You can source lib/*.sh directly in Bats without going through the CLI, isolating pure functions.
Re-use / composition	New entrypoints (e.g. bin/snapshot) can reuse logging, env, deps checks with zero duplication.
Distribution	Add project-root/bin to $PATH; everything ‚Äújust works‚Äù because scripts find lib relative to themselves.
Hard exits quarantined	Only bin/ scripts decide final exit; library functions return or throw recoverable errors ‚Üí easier mocking.
5. Practical invariants/constraints to encode
Layer	Must guarantee before returning	Must not do
lib/env_init.sh	Required vars exported & validated.	No user-visible output except on --verbose.
lib/deps.sh	All binaries/versions meet spec or non-zero return.	Installing things silently.
lib/logger.sh	Consistent log format; respects $QUIET.	Exit.
bin/*	Map return codes to unified exits; cleanup temp files.	Implement deep logic; that belongs in lib.
6. Integration with your structure-drift project

    Logger reuse: Drop your existing logger.sh and logger_wrapper.sh into lib/logger.sh.
    Update calls to source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/logger.sh".

    Validator script: Move the heavy checks from system/structure_validator.sh into lib/structure_validator.sh. Then make bin/validate a 20-line wrapper that just calls structure_validate.

    Tests:

    # In Bats
    load "$PROJECT_ROOT/lib/structure_validator.sh"
    @test "Missing spec returns non-zero" { structure_validate "./missing.spec"; [ "$?" -ne 0 ]; }

    Faster than shelling out each time.

7. Variations you can adopt later
Variation	When to adopt
libexec/ for private helpers	If you want to expose some libs to users (public API) and hide others.
share/ or data/	Store sample specs, templates, completion scripts.
Make install	Symlink bin/* into /usr/local/bin so users run structure-validate globally.
Namespace prefix	Name libs sd_*.sh (for structural-drift) to avoid sourcing conflicts across projects.
TL;DR

    bin/: interface ‚Äî minimal, user-facing, handles parsing & exit codes.

    lib/: implementation ‚Äî reusable, testable, SRP-compliant modules.

Start by carving out one function (e.g., env initialization) into lib/, adjust imports, run tests, then iteratively migrate the rest. Each extract reduces coupling and moves you closer to a clean, maintainable toolchain.
