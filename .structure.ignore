# Ignore these files/paths from structure validation
# Format: relative paths or wildcards
# Comments and blank lines are allowed

#ðŸ§ª Youâ€™re still iterating on it	You donâ€™t want to commit it to your contract yet
#ðŸ§¹ Itâ€™s a tooling support file	Not core to application structure
#ðŸ’£ Including it in structure.spec makes it "enforced"	But that doesnâ€™t make sense â€” itâ€™s the enforcement config itself
#ðŸ’¡ Most tools (e.g. .gitignore, .prettierignore) are ignored by default in their own domains	Same philosophy applies here
